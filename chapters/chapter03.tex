         \textbf{Interpretation} & \textbf{Weight} & \textbf{Interval} \\
         \hline
         Strongly Agree          & 5               & 4.21-5.00         \\
         \hline
         Agree                   & 4               & 3.41-4.20         \\
         \hline
         Neutral                 & 3               & 2.61-3.40         \\
         \hline
         Disagree                & 2               & 1.81-2.60         \\
         \hline
         Strongly Disagree       & 1               & 0-1.80            \\
         \hline
      \end{tabular}
   \end{center}
   \caption{5-point Likert's Scale by Rensis Likert}
\end{table}

\textbf{Likert Scale.}
It measures the statement of agreement of the person by means of a questionnaire that requires them to indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with a series of statements.

\textbf{Weighted Mean.}
The proponents used the mean to measure the ratings of the respondents regarding on the performance and effectiveness of the proposed system.

\begin{equation*}
   \begin{split}
      \text{Weighted Mean (WM)} & = \frac{\sum f(x1 + x2 + ... + xn)}{N} \\
   \end{split}
\end{equation*}

Where:

\begin{equation*}
   \begin{split}
      \frac{\sum f(x1 + x2 + ... + xn)}{N} & = \text{summation of all means of each criterion} \\
      N & = \text{number of criteria}
   \end{split}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Percentage.}
This is used to determine the qualitative ratio of the data gathered, it is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100.

\begin{equation*}
   \begin{split}
      \text{Percentage (P)} & = \frac{F}{N} \times 100
   \end{split}
\end{equation*}

Where:

\begin{equation*}
   \begin{split}
      F & = \text{frequency of a numeric rating for some given criteria} \\
      N & = \text{represents the total number of the respondents}
   \end{split}
\end{equation*}

   \end{center}
\end{figure}

The following are the methods and procedures used by the proponents in the implementation of the proposed system.

\textbf{Phase 1. Requirement Analysis.}
Requirement Analysis, also known as Requirement Engineering, is the process of defining user expectations for a new software being built or modified.
In software engineering, it is sometimes referred to as requirements gathering or requirements capturing such that determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product or project.
The proponents based the requirements needed on the current system of online examination of AMA Computer College Parañaque.

The following Use Case Diagram illustrates the requirements needed to build and develop the proposed system.

      \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{dfd.jpg}
      \caption{Use Case Diagram of the Proposed System}
   \end{center}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Phase 2. Software Design.}
After determining the requirements needed, a system design is created.
This includes the important aspects of the system to the user.
The proponents aim to design the Proctor Vue: Automated online proctor Web application with four major components: (1) Authentication, (2) Settings, (3) Home, (4) Courses.

The software design of the proposed system is represented by the following Hierarchical Input-Process-Output (HIPO) diagrams

   \end{center}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Phase 4. User Evaluation}
The built system through the first prototype is presented to the respondents as part of the development process.
The proponents gathered opinions from the respondents to know what more features should be added to the proposed system.
From the first prototype, the proponents were told to add or modify the following features:

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Add a calendar section to view upcoming and closing exams.
   \item Verifying the face of the registered examinee before letting them take the exam.
   \item Adding 'Exam Navigation' section to view answered and un-answered questions.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Phase 5. Refining Prototype}
After the respondents' evaluation, the requirements are refined accordingly.
Features such as calendar and exam navigation section were added, and the students will only be able to take the exam after the face recognition.

      \includegraphics[scale=1]{prototype2-1.png}
      \caption{Second Prototype: Dashboard}
   \end{center}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Phase 6. Final Product.}
Given the methods and procedures used, the proposed software is considered final and is available for use.
After performing several tests, the software is deployed.
The final product is then evaluated by the selected students using effectiveness, functionality, and user experience.

\section{System Features}

In this section, the features of the Proctor Vue: Web-based Automated Online Proctor will be discussed.

\textbf{Face recognition.}
Through Artificial Intelligence, the proposed system can verify if the person taking the exam is the registered face of the student in the account.
If the recognition failed, the student cannot take the exam.
Also, when the students is already taking the exam, and the system cannot detect the face for 10 seconds, the system will provide 1 warning to the student.

\textbf{Alt-tab switching detection.}
The proposed system will recognize if the examinee is trying to switch their tabs through patterns of behavior made by the student.
Once detected, a warning will be automatically given.

\textbf{Shutdown.}
Automatically shutting down the exam when the student reached 5 consecutive warnings.
The answered questions prior to the shutdown will determine the score of the students.

\textbf{Return on Investment.}
The Return on Investment of the proposed software is calculated by dividing the positive cashflows which is the difference of benefit and cost into the negative cashflow: cost.

The total is then converted to percentage which yields to 211\% Return on investment every year.

\begin{equation*}
   \begin{split}
      \text{Cost Benefit Ratio} & = 3.11 \\
      \text{ROI (annual)} & = 211\%
   \end{split}
\end{equation*}

\section{Description of the Prototype}

Proctor Vue will implement facial detection/recognition during online exams for different courses.
These exams will be created by the assigned coordinator in each course through Proctor Vue.
Student users are required to upload an image of themselves.
Before taking the exam, the system must verify if the uploaded picture is the one taking the exam in order to proceed.
During the exam, the student's face must be seen and recognized, unable to detect face for 10 seconds will automatically add 1 warning.
Alt-tab switching is tracked, if the system detects the activity, it will add 1 warning.
Maxing out the set number of warnings for the exam will automatically submit the score of the students.

\section{Implementation Plan}

The developed system will be sent to AMA Computer College Parañaque right away after the revision to present it once more to the end users.
If the company wants to adopt the proposed system, the proponents will hand over the system together with its documentation which will serve as a guide to the Administrator who will be assigned for the system's update and maintenance.
There will be a letter of agreement that the system will be handed over to the company freely and the researchers are no longer responsible for the updates and maintenance.

If the system will be implemented, the researchers will conduct several strategies as presented below.
