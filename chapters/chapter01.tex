\chapter{Project and Its Background}

\section{Project Context}

Online/distance learning has become an increasingly popular method of receiving a higher education, often serving an off-campus population who cannot attend class on campus \cite{daffin2018comparing} since the online environment provides flexibility, and supports various learning styles.
Online education includes Online assessment activities which has a number of issues and challenges in relation to academic integrity.

Academic integrity can be defined as honesty in students' academic work; it includes trusting in one’s intellect and abstaining from plagiarism, unauthorized collaborations, cheating, and facilitating any unapproved academic behavior \cite{cronan2017changing}.
Academic integrity upholds the value of online/distance learning program and the credibility of the organization universities offering the program.

\citeA{berkey2015cheating} have examined the sensitive subject of cheating in online courses, and found an alarming 84 of 141 students who responded to their survey agreed that student dishonesty in online test taking was a significant issue.
This is not a surprising phenomenon, as we live in the age of the information superhighway and students can find whatever they want to on the Internet with just a click or two of a mouse \cite{daffin2018comparing}.
The major way of coping with this challenge to refrain academic dishonesty is the adoption of online proctoring system for online assessments.
Online proctoring systems combats academic dishonesty as it produces a secure solution in monitoring test takers.
According to \citeA{hussein2020exploring}, the four major features of online proctoring systems are; (i) authentication: ensuring the validity of test taker, (ii) browsing tolerance: setting the limit of student’s ability to use their computer for other tasks, (iii) remote authorizing and control: enabling the proctor to start, pause and end online proctored exam, and flagging any suspicious student behaviours, and (iv) report generation: which is the creation of reports of a student’s activities during exam.

There are numerous online proctoring services that are appearing on the market that portend to offer test integrity.
However, there are instances that they are remained untried and untested mainly because of the cost of service and their technical requirements.
Privacy protection and management, security and anti-fraud measures are also other key issues that need to be examined when considering an online proctoring system \cite{sietses2016white}.

\section{Purpose and Description}

Due to the COVID 19 Pandemic where onsite teaching is temporarily ceased, AMA Computer College Parañaque implements full distance learning prior to blended learning for students to continue their education.
It is a full online learning platform where the results in every online assessments of every course sums the performance or academic grade of the students.
This profound a convenient way of receiving a college degree, students should just have to study online and pass the assessment.
However, there is a gap.
AMA Computer College Parañaque is still conducting an unproctored online examinations, which is prone to academic dishonesty.

It is very common for students to cheat in an unproctored online exams as it gives them the privilege to utilize the internet to ace their scores.
Due to this, when comparing the scores to the proctored online courses or the traditional classroom, scores are significantly higher \cite{weiner2017comparative}.
However, the results are considered inconsequential as it has no impact on student’s educational growth.

AMA Computer College Parañaque online examinations has 2 major challenges.
First, answers are leaked online.
Answer sheets are easily bought online from lots of websites like Course Hero, where student can access the resources and copies the answers.
Also, students can still open their modules while taking the exam.
Second, no student authentication.
There is no guarantee that the enrolled student that owns the account is the one taking the exam.
There are a lot of cases where students pay for someone to take the exam for them.
These are a serious issue for academic integrity and the distance learning credibility that needs to be prevented.
Otherwise, failure to prevent or detect academic dishonesty encourages students to continue cheating practices \cite{teh2013reducing}.

It is the school’s obligation to provide as fair an assessment of each student’s performance as possible \cite{lundahl2010skolbedomningens}.
Having considered the above issues and concerns, the researcher was motivated to propose the innovation of the current Online Assessment with Proctor Vue - automated online examination proctor for AMA Computer College Parañaque.

Proctor Vue is a platform promoting academic integrity with its features: (i) Face Recognition: to ensure student’s solitude before and throughout the assessment, (ii) Lockdown: to automatically end the assessment when detecting many attempts of student tab switching and any other potential workarounds.

\section{Objective of the Study}
This research aims to develop Proctor Vue: Automated Online Examination Proctor for AMA Computer College Parañaque and will address the following:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item To identify the different ways to prevent malpractices that is conducted during online examination.
   \item To design and create a web-based Online Examination Proctor to eliminate cheating activities during online examination.
   \item To assess the effectivity and usability of the web-based Automated Online Examination Proctor.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Significance of the Study}

Proctor Vue: Automated Online Examination proctor is undertaken with the main purpose of detecting and preventing student’s malpractices during online examination to attain academic integrity in the online learning environment of AMA Computer College Parañaque. This program generously benefits the students, professor or teaching assistants, and the administration of AMA Computer College Parañaque.

\textbf{Students} - The effectivity of the system will benefit them as practicing online exam integrity and minimizing cheating dependency would maximize their opportunity to learn, develop and improve skills, and obtain an educational degree that reflects their own academic achievements.

\textbf{Professor or teaching assistants} - The system is important to the faculty members, since it will provide them the fairly evaluated student’s performance. With this, Professor or teaching assistants would be able to track student’s difficulties, and check for any improvements of the online courses or assessments.

\textbf{AMA Computer College Parañaque} - The effectiveness of the system will provide the administration a fair distance learning environment that would produce graduates whom is practiced with academic integrity.

\section{Scope and Limitation}

Proctor Vue is a program designed for AMA Computer College Parañaque examination faculty and enrolled students qualified for assessments of online courses.
It provides features limited to: Face recognition and detection of tab switching.

Proctor Vue is an Automated online proctor that is a relatively new technology that uses the student’s webcam and microphone to verify student and student’s exam activities.
It is empowered by Artificial Intelligence.
Therefore, there is no proctor nor licensed online proctor needed to facilitate examinations.

The study only focuses on the effectivity of the system for the students who are currently enrolled in the full online learning platform of AMA computer college Parañaque.
