  abstract = {With the rise of new examination methods and tools, new cheating methods have been born. In the recent years information technology has been constantly improving its support for teachers with different kind of tools. These tools help teachers organize their courses and exams better. They include various paid and open-source Learning Management Systems, SCORM modules and other solutions. While developing course and exam materials electronically is an efficient way to improve the way one teaches, not everyone considers the dangers caused by various new cheating methods. Some advanced methods can exploit security holes in the electronic information systems, but most of them are not that sophisticated. In this paper we demonstrate how dishonest students cheat on the exams and what teachers can do to prevent this from happening.}
